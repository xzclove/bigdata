As genetic engineering becomes the norm, ‘the fate of the human face will be increasingly determined by human tastes’writes Dr Kwan, while foreheads will continue to expand as our brains continue to grow larger.
As man achieves total mastery over genetics, the human face will become heavily biased towards features that humans find fundamentally appealing: strong, regal lines, straight nose, intense eyes, and placement of facial features that adhere to the golden ratio and left/right perfect symmetry.
Dr Kwan believes eyes will grow 'unnervingly large' as the human race colonizes the solar system and people start living in the dimmer environments of colonies further away from the sun.
In fact, by 2050, a completely new type of human will evolve as a result of radical new technology, behaviour, and natural selection.
