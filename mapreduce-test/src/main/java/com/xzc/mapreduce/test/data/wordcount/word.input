Climate change, artificial intelligence and genetic mutations are all set to transform our bodies in drastic ways, according to a recent video. We could for instance, develop red eyes as our DNA mutates, and have darker skin as an evolutionary response to global warming.
As global warming takes hold, humans will also be skinnier and taller, it predicts, as this body shape is better able to dissipate heat. Our faces may also change dramatically, according to Dr Alan Kwan, who holds a PhD in computational genomics from Washington University in St Louis.
Dr Kawn has created a stunning series of images which display one possible evolution for the human race over the next 100,000 years.
Dr Kwan believes that key to our future evolution will be man ‘wresting control’ of the human form from natural evolution and adapting human biology to suit our needs.
As genetic engineering becomes the norm, ‘the fate of the human face will be increasingly determined by human tastes’writes Dr Kwan, while foreheads will continue to expand as our brains continue to grow larger.
As man achieves total mastery over genetics, the human face will become heavily biased towards features that humans find fundamentally appealing: strong, regal lines, straight nose, intense eyes, and placement of facial features that adhere to the golden ratio and left/right perfect symmetry.
